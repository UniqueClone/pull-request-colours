# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Azure DevOps PR File Colors extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon  
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon

## Creating Icons

You can either:

1. **Use the icon generator**: Open `create-icons.html` in a web browser and click "Generate and Download Icons" to automatically create and download the PNG files.

2. **Create manually**: Create simple PNG files with the following characteristics:
   - Blue circular background (#0078d4)
   - White border
   - Symbol representing code/files (like `{}` or colorful dots for file types)

## Quick Manual Creation

If you need quick placeholder icons, you can:

1. Create solid blue squares of the required sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) using any image editor
2. Save them as PNG files with the correct names
3. The extension will work with any valid PNG icons

## Icon Design

The icons should represent the concept of color-coding different file types in code reviews. Suggested elements:
- Blue background (matching Azure DevOps theme)
- Multiple colored dots or symbols representing different file types
- Clean, minimal design that works at small sizes
